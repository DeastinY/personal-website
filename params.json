{"name":"Richard Polzin","tagline":"Website","body":"Welcome to my website ! Here you'll mainly find contact information and links to public projects.\r\n\r\n### About me\r\nBorn 1994 in Aachen I stayed around Aachen until now. I've started the Bachelor of Science in 2013 and am looking forward to finishing it this year. Right now I'm torn up between different possibilities that come afterwards, but I'm tending towards an AI Master course in Maastricht.\r\n\r\nProfessionally I'm very interested in readable and understandable code. Most of my experience is with C# and Java but it's slowly shifting towards Python. Mobile development, Web 2.0 and microcontroller/server-sided knowledge can be added to that portfolio due to a personal interest.\r\n\r\nRecreational time is often spend making music (bass, drums or vocals) and drinking coffee (lovely portafilter machine). I recently rediscovered photography and digital art in general.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n- polzin.richard@gmail.com\r\n- Telegramm: https://telegram.me/DeastinY","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
